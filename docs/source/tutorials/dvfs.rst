DVFS
******************************************************

Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling policies can be deployed to optimize the energy consumption of underutilized resources.
Such technique can scale down the processor frequency based on its usage pattern to allow energy savings when jobs are not 
executing computation intensive tasks.

This tutorial can be used to understand how DVFS policies can be implemented with batsim-py.
