    "The Shutdown Problem consist of determining the moments to switch off resources in order to save energy. Idle resources consume non-negligible amounts of energy that can be minimized by simply turning them off but the energy/time required to switch On-Off resources can be costly. Therefore, the shutdown policy must balance between performance and energy efficiency.\n",
